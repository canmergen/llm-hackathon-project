# data/banka_dokumanlari/ (Uncommented to include Hackathon public data)
# We keep teblig/ as it is public legislation, but ignore raw large files if any. 
# For this hackathon, usually better to ignore data/ entirely if it's large, but structure is needed.
# Let's ignore content of data but keep gitkeep if needed, or just ignore specific subfolders.
# Ignoring bank documents is crucial for privacy/size.
